## Summarize: 
Users can play the notorious hangman game but there is a catch. The game manipulates the word as much as it can because it is evil. Users can also change the difficulty by adjusting the following options: length of word, max attempts and whether the game should be evil or not. An user can always look back at their previous games that have been played.

## Beta features:
*	Upon launch the user can immediately start playing.
*	The current word that has to be guessed is visible on the main screen including some placeholder.
*	Users can see their incorrect guess and how many attempts they have left.
*	Users have access to a list of all incorrect guesses.
*	Users can use the on-screen keyboard to input guesses. The keyboard can hidden in case they have a hardware keyboard.
*	Guessing a word is case-unsensitive.
*	Invalid input will be ignored while notifying the user.
*	Users can start a new game whenever they want
*	The application has a title
*	The gameplay will end whenever a user wins or loses.
*	The difficulty of the game can be adjusted by changing the following options: length of word, max attempts or whether the game should be evil or not.
